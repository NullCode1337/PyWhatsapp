8. Set up your client's [subscription] using your `https://<your-subdomain>.herokuapp.com/whatsapi` as the callback URL. It is recommended that you set a `TOKEN` and `APP_SECRET` [config var](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) as part of the set up of your Heroku app to secure requests. If you choose not to set a config var, then you will need to set a verify token of 'token' when configuring the callback URL.
